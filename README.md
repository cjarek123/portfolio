# portfolio
a collection of projects I've completed for school or for fun

these projects were selected to show off my experience with various
coding languages, as well as including both team and solo projects.


CS361_Project:
CS361, Data Structures and Algorithms, specifically taught big O
notation and custom data structures. My final project is provided.
It involved creating six different sorting algorithms in total, and
was meant to be a group project, however I completed it individually.
The algorithms included three basic, well-known methods. And three
variations.
heapSort.py  -> quadHeapSort.py
mergeSort.py -> triMergeSort.py
quickSort.py -> randomizedQuickSort.py

Each algorithm is written in python and utilized different custom data structures.


datalab_C:
Created for CS341L, Introduction to Computer Architecture and Organizaion, this
project included several programs provided to me for testing purposes. The primary
file is datalab-handout/bits.c
In this assignment, I was provided with 15 different coding "puzzles," with strict
limitations on how I was allowed to solve them. Throughout the project I was only allowed
to use bitwise operators (AND, OR, XOR, PLUS, NOT, etc..). And for all but two of these
problems, I was also not allowed to use any flow-control statements (if, while, for, etc..)

This project was written in c, and was completed individually. The purpose of the datalab
project was to display our mastery over bitwise operations, and get us prepared to learn
how to interprete and write assembly code, which was taught in the latter half of the course.


haskellCards:
Created for CS357, Declarative Programming, this was my final group-project for the class.
In this class we were taught how to write in declarative languages. Specifically we were
taught how to write in Scheme and Haskell. The main difference between a declarative
language (such as scheme or haskell) and an imperative one (such as python, c, java). Is
that in an imperative program, you specifically direct the control-flow. Even in the
datalab_C project, described above, where control-flow operators were banned, the program
still executes in a strict order, line by line.
In a declarative language however, functions are not preformed unless they are called. 
And involves declaring what the program does, rather than how it does it.

In this project I worked in a team of three people to create an itallian card game, 
called briscola. I primarily worked within the computer.hs class, but also helped
incorperate it into the Main class, and some other functions there.
The card game is played individually, or on a local network, with a total of four
"players." Any missing players are replaced with computer opponents.
