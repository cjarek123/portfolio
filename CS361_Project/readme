Each program has a boilerplate, which I've formatted the same for convienience.
This boilerplate uses the random library to automatically generate a list of random integers
between a given range. This list is then sorted using the algorithm.

For testing you may want to un-comment the code within these boilerplates in order to print the
before and after lists. 

To set the size of the test list, change the value of 'n' in each boilerplate to hte desired length,
a smaller size is recommended for simple testing.
